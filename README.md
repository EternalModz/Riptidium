# Introduction
Riptidium is an ongoing project I’ve been developing for quite some time. It delivers a solid and reliable experience while keeping the game fast and optimized, providing exceptionally high FPS. The pack includes several features that OptiFine included in the past. It also includes several quality-of-life improvements to enhance user-friendliness and immersion. I've also ensured it contains all of [AntVenom's](https://youtube.com/AntVenom) must-have mods.

# Installation
To install Riptidium, download it directly from Modrinth or use a third-party Minecraft launcher like [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) to access the pack.

# Vulkan & Sodium
Riptidium comes in two versions: one built around Vulkan and the other around Sodium.

| Feature      | Vulkan Version | Sodium Version |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **FPS Performance** | Highest FPS, ideal for PvP and adventuring | Optimized performance with Sodium-exclusive features |
| **Shader Support** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Supported |
| **GPU Requirements** | No specific requirements | NVIDIA GPU (GTX 1600 or newer) required for Nvidium *(auto-disabled if unsupported)* |
| **Render Distance Optimization** | Standard | Uses Nvidium for enhanced performance |
| **Minecraft Version Support** | Likely broader compatibility | Limited to Minecraft 1.21.1 (latest Nvidium-supported version) |
| **Mod Compatibility** | General mod support | Requires mods explicitly supporting Sodium 5.11 to avoid crashes |

# Updates
Both versions of Riptidium will be updated as needed. However, the Sodium-based version may remain on 1.21.1 until Nvidium supports newer versions of Sodium. The Vulkan-based version will continue to run the latest versions of Minecraft flawlessly.
